# The adapter pattern is a design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to
# work together by wrapping an instance of the adaptee class with a class that conforms to the
# target interface. This pattern is useful when you want to reuse existing classes that cannot
# be modified to fit the required interface, and it promotes loose coupling between classes.
# In Python, the adapter pattern can be implemented by creating a class that wraps an instance
# of the adaptee class and implements the target interface.

# Here is an example of how the adapter pattern can be implemented in Python:

class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self):
        return "Adaptee's specific request"


class Target:
    def request(self):
        pass


class Adapter(Target):
    def __init__(self, adaptee):
        self._adaptee = adaptee

    def request(self):
        return self._adaptee.specific_request()


# Client code
adaptee = Adaptee()
adapter = Adapter(adaptee)
print(adapter.request())

# In this example, the Adaptee class defines a specific interface that the client wants to use,
# but it’s not compatible with the client’s code. The Target class defines the interface that
# the client code expects. The Adapter class wraps an instance of the Adaptee class and
# implements the Target interface, so it can be used by the client code. In this example,
# the client code creates an instance of the Adaptee class, an instance of the Adapter class
# and passes the Adaptee instance to the Adapter constructor, then it calls the request() method
# on the Adapter instance. The Adapter class receives the request, and then it delegates the
# request to the Adaptee class’s specific_request() method. The output of the code is
# “Adaptee’s specific request”
