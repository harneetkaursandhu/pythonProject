# In Python, a function declaration begins with the keyword def and is followed by the function name.
def show_hello():
    print("Hello there, this is my very first function!!!\n\n")


print("Testing my first user defined function...\n\n")

# invoking the function
show_hello()

# invoking the function again
show_hello()

# The function is defined on lines 2 and 3. The syntax uses the def keyword, followed by the name
# of the function. The opened and closed parenthesis are also needed. In this case, they are empty.
# This means that the function can be called will no additional parameters.
# The end of line 2 uses a colon ":" to start the code block. The block contains all the logic that
# the function performs. All logic code must be indented to the function definition
